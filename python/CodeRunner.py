# Let's create an example in Python that demonstrates how to execute a simple program written in another language,
# and then capture its execution time, memory usage, and output.

# For this example, we will execute a simple C++ program that prints "Hello, World!".
# We will use the `subprocess` module to run the C++ code and the `resource` module to measure the memory usage.

import subprocess
import os
import resource
import time

#include <iostream>

    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
